To run the preprocessing code you will need to install the [body keypoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5mfrc2g4ZEzzNjW6CEVjLvNTZcmPanB/view?usp=sharing).
First run the video downloader file, and make sure that you are using the asl20.json or just use the dataset located [here](https://virginiatech-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jboyle1013_vt_edu/EVUHfdyBg3FDgUYSY7NkVbABdgDRMPc4Ira-lkRmUEyWnQ?e=jxgbi0).
If you downloaded the dataset above you can skip this step, as you have everything you need to train.
Then run the preprocessing, either cleaned or 300 in a unix environment, a bash script is used to make sure that all of the raw video files are mp4s.
