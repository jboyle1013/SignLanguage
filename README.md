 Final Project For ECE4424/CS4824

## Dataset
We are using the MS-ASL 100 Subset of the MS-ASL Dataset.

## Extracting the Dataset
To extract the dataset either run the extract_zipped_dataset.py file or select the data.zip.001 and use 7zip to extract it. 
If you pick the second option, I would advise naming the destination file "data" since I already have the repo set to 
ignore that folder.


Both methods require 7zip to be installed. One is just a quick script that simplifies the process
